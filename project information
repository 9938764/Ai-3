I actually created it for the students for the student's study purposes, An FTP server for a school can be a valuable resource for students to access study materials and educational resources. Here's how an FTP server can help students with their study materials:

1. **Centralized Resource Repository**: An FTP server provides a centralized location for storing and managing study materials. Teachers and administrators can upload and organize study materials, making it easy for students to access course-related content in one place.

2. **24/7 Access**: Students can access the FTP server at any time, allowing them to study and review materials outside of regular school hours. This flexibility can be especially useful for students with different learning styles and schedules.

3. **Easy File Sharing**: Teachers can share lecture notes, presentations, assignments, and other resources with students through the FTP server. Students can download these materials and use them for studying and completing assignments.

4. **Large File Support**: FTP is well-suited for transferring large files, such as multimedia content and research materials. This is particularly valuable for courses that involve videos, diagrams, and other media.

5. **Organized Content**: Study materials on the FTP server can be organized into folders and subdirectories by subject, class, or teacher. This makes it easy for students to locate the specific resources they need.

6. **Revision Materials**: Students can access previous years' study materials, which can be valuable for exam preparation and revision. This archive of resources allows students to review and reinforce their learning.

7. **Collaboration**: Students can collaborate with their peers by sharing notes, study guides, and other educational content through the FTP server. This encourages teamwork and knowledge-sharing.

8. **Access to Homework and Assignments**: Teachers can upload assignment instructions and homework tasks to the FTP server. Students can submit completed assignments through the server, making it a convenient platform for homework management.

9. **Reduced Printing Costs**: Accessing study materials digitally can reduce the need for printing handouts, which can be cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

10. **Backup and Data Recovery**: Files on the FTP server are typically backed up regularly. In case students accidentally delete or lose study materials, they can request replacements from the backup.

11. **Scalability**: The FTP server can be scaled to accommodate the growing number of study materials and students as the school expands.
